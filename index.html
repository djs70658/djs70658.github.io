My Dream
</h2>
<p title="Why I Haven't Gone">Traveling has always been something that I've dreamt of doing. Unfortunately, life always seems to get in the way. Whether it be financial issues, time restraints, or personal obstacles; I always find myself with some reason as to why I can't travel the world. I know that I should try to be spontaneous every now and then, but <b>I'm a dreamer. I'm a dreamer that likes to plan. Boy, have I been planning. </b> </p>
<p title="In the Meantime"> While I wait for the right moment, whether it be tomorrow or next year, I placate myself by dreaming of all the places I will go. I want to travel to places that I can't even imagine existing. I want to explore mountains and swin in lakes. I want to experience life outside of little old Georgia. I want to be a part of the beautiful world out there. There is such a vast and magnificent world out there just waiting for me to come explore it, and I intend to face this adventure head on with a reserve of dreams to fulfill. </p>
<p title="This Website's Purpose"> I made this website with the intention of using it to compile annecdotes about my future travels, and eventually I will use it as a portfolio of the places I have gone. I have pieced together links, lists, tables, and much more to help me get a better look at the future I have laid out before my feet. While I sit and continue with my studies, I know that this will always be a place for me to sit and remind myself that there is so much more than Georgia. Journaling has always been a hobby of mine, and I see this web page as a virtual extension of my journaling. I know that this will easily be one of my favorite pages to visit. </p>

Helpful Links
</h2>
<p> I have compiled a quick set of links that might come in handy when trying to plan out a trip overseas or even one state over. Feel free to use these, I know I will be sometime soon! Planning is key in things like airfare and hotel booking. The sooner you schedule your flights or rooms, the cheaper they will be. I know money can get tight during extensive travel, and the best option available to people like me is to plan ahead and search for the best deals! </p>

Not Sure Where to Start
</h2> 
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cTum7Af.jpg" alt="travel" style="width:480px;height:320px;"></td>
        <td>I want to travel, but where would I even start? I have no idea where I might begin this journey outside of my comfort zone. It makes me nervous and excited at the same time. I have to pick just the right place to kick start this journey. Traveling, alone especially, is a scary thing. You must learn to embrace your fears and take the first step to make dreams come true. </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<h2 style="color:#423825;"> The Choice is Mine </h2>
<p title="What do you think?"> When it comes down to it, I know that it will really be up to me to decide where and when to start this amazing journey around the world. I will have to carefully weigh my options and make a choice that is right for me. I know this, but I can still take a moment to see what everyone else thinks! I've included some buttons that you can click below this paragraph. Take a moment and read the alert boxes that tell you a little more about each decision I might make. </p>
<p>
<button type="button" onclick="alert('Ireland has so much to offer, from rolling landscape to traditional festivals and mysterious local legends. If I choose to visit Ireland first, I will defintiely have a ball and kick start an amazing journey.')">Ireland!</button> or
<button type="button" onclick="alert('Sweden is just one of those really cool countries that I feel like would change my life. Just to be able to sit there and really appreciate the magnificent views and to be able to spend some time in nature would be refreshing.')">Sweden!</button> or
<button type="button" onclick="alert('I've always been fascinated with the idea of going to Germany. It has such rich cultural features and historical attractions that it would be an awesome first stop in my journey across the world.')">Germany!</button> 

<h3>Mark Twain once said:</h3>
<blockquote> <p> Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all oneâ€™s lifetime.</p>
